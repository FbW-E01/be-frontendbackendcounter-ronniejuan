# Backend - Frontend-Backend Counter

1. Create two folders into this project
    - frontend
    - backend
2. Into the frontend, create a minimal react app
    - Two buttons; one for each backend endpoint
3. Into the backend, create a minimal express backend with two 
    - GET "/"
    - POST "/"
4. The functionality should be just a basic counter
    - The backend is just a counter
    - The GET endpoint returns the current number
    - The POST endpoint increases the current number by 1
